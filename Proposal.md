## The Problem 

From fresh Maine lobster to Korean BBQ, the variety offered by NYC food trucks is as diverse as the city itself.  Along with relatively cheap prices and convenience, food trucks are a great alternative to crowded and expensive NYC restaurants.  But how does one go about finding all these amazing food trucks? It’s hard to know where they are, especially since they often change locations. What’s on their menus? What are their hours? And perhaps most importantly, which ones are the really good ones?  

## The Solution 

There’s an app for that! AccessFoodNYC! AccessFoodNYC will use open source data along with crowd sourcing and GPS to give users the current location, menus, and reviews of food trucks in NYC.  AccessFoodNYC will allow users to search food trucks by type of cuisine and distance.  Using the Yelp api, users can see reviews of a given food truck.  AccessFoodNYC will also pull information from social media to allow users to see what food trucks their friends have been eating at and what they thought about them.  A sign-in feature will allow users to save their favorite food trucks and track them.  Wait, there’s more! That’s just one half of AccessFoodNYC! The other half is dedicated to vendors. In this side of the app, with a push of a button, vendors can update their location.  By pushing a few more buttons, vendors can update their menus, prices, hours, and offer discounts or promotions. This side of the app will also provide vendors with resources for things such as license renewals and permits. Dope right.

## Execution
