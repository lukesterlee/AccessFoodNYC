## Weekly Retro 0  

**Goals for last Sprint**:
Are goals for last week's sprint included making a basic UX flow and implementing material design standards to the UI. We also wanted to add a map feature using the Google API and a sign-in feature using Parse.

**Goals for this Sprint**:
Are goal for this week's sprint is to plot food trucks onto our map using the Yelp API. We will also continue implementing material design standards to UI.

**Guiding Questions** (consider before the meeting):
  *  What went well?
     We were successful in making a basic UX flow, implementing a sign-in feature, and a map feature. 
 
  *  What should we do differently next time? What did we learn?
     Next time we need to add a better git ignore. Merge conflicts were an issue the cost us a lot of time. That issue could have easily been avoided with a better git ignore.
     Next time we also need to better divide up what part of the app each team member will work on.  
  
  *  What still puzzles us?
     How to implement material design into our app is still puzzling, we are also not sure if using the Yelp API is the best way to get our data.
 
**Team Member Analysis**:
If you did not meet your goals, how will this affect the progression of the product? What will you do differently to meet your goals this week?
Not meeting weekly goals adds to the next weeks workload and puts us behind schedule, limiting the amount of bonuses features we can add on
